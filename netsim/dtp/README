[N.B]
1. The initial RTO is set to be 3000, because it was sufficient enough for my own test cases.
But if the RTT increases, you may need to set the initial RTO to some higher value for the program to run properly 
under very lossy conditions.
2. The FIN signal from sender side is sent immediately after it receives the SYN-ACK from receiver and sends ACK.
